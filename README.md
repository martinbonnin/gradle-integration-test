A simple repo to test making GradleRunner tests using included build

* To develop the plugin, open `plugin`
* To develop the integration tests, open `integration-tests`
* To develop the build under test, open `test-project`

`test-project` is checked in source control but could as well be generated dynamically from `integration-tests`
